Artemis financial is a financial consulting company that develops individual financial plans for their clients which includes insurance investments retirement and savings.

I did well in identifying the security issues in the software that were present and the future for a financial institution. There are specific laws in place that govern data protection and privacy. I did well in applying standard security practices to the refractored code.

I found it quite challenging to eliminate the false positives and the dependency check because as I suppressed one another one will pop up. It is a lot easier to just update the entire spring boot dependency.  It was also very helpful to look at only the dependencies used in the project and not the ones used for the dependency check.

To share the software and application where functional and secure I first used design patterns that had security in mind. I also looked to see any dependencies that had vulnerabilities and read the known fixes. After I reflected the code are use the dependency check to see if I had any vulnerabilities. The dependency check itself used a lot of external library's that had known vulnerabilities that I would come down before releasing the software.  Add some difficulties with the eclipse IDE to update the dependencies so instead I went with the gitHub bot.

I used common design patterns that are tried and tested to work. The gitHub but was very useful for updating the dependencies.   

I would like to showcase my ability to use the gitHub but along with the design patterns are used in this project.
